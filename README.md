THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

IT IS NOT READY FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION

BEYOND THE EXAMPLES THERE IS NO FUNCTIONAL DOCUMENTATION (YET)<BR>
THE EXAMPLES DEPEND ON THE M2_IO LIBRARY (FOR BUTTONS & LEDs)

THIS LIBRARY IS *NOT* ABOUT A USER-FRIENDLY INTERFACE <BR>
NOR IS IT ABOUT ERROR-CHECKING EVERYTHING YOU SEND IT<BR>
IT IS ABOUT SPEED AND EFFICIENCY

IF YOU WANT USER-FRIENDLY AND RESILIENT, WITH GOOD SUPPORT<BR>
YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT COLLINS DUE_CAN (AND SUPPORTING LIBRARIES)
